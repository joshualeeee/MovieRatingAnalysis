# Individual Analysis Proposal

## 1. What question are you trying to answer?

I want to analyze trends in the most-produced types of movies and how these trends vary across different countries. Movie types can be categorized based on shared attributes such as genres, age ratings, or release types. Specifically, I want to examine how those preferences in movies evolve over time.

## 2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.

I love watching movies and would be interested to explore if the popularity of certain film genres/types reflects cultural shifts, societal values, or global influences.

## 3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?

My hypothesis is that dominant movie types in each country shift over time in response to cultural, political, and technological changes. For example, historical events like wars might increase action/war movies being produced.

## 4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
