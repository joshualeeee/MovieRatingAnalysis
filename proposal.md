# Individual Analysis Proposal
## 1. What question are you trying to answer?
I want to anaylze how different factors affect movie ratings. Are there certain actors that highly boost/lower movie ratings? How does genre and country filmed in affect movie ratings?

## 2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.
I love watching movies but a lot of times I feel like movie ratings can be biased and skewed. I have watched great movies with average ratings and bad movies with good ratings, so I would be interested to see if certain factors tend to shift movie ratings higher/lower. 

## 3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?
My hypothesis is that mainstream American movies with well-known casts will skew higher. 

## 4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
